A simple introduction scenario.

None of the adventurer knows eachother, and they awake in the prison of a cultist's Lair without any weapon.
After their escape (a Thief can try to open the gate with concealed tools, a mage can try to melt the lock with magic fire or acid, or they can try to beark the door by pure force), they must find weapons, and try to find the exit.

During their search they will disturb a devil invocation, and it is probably best that they try to stop it :-)

They must:
* at least escape
* Save the children that will be sacrificed to a invocated Devil
* Send him back to Hell (they do not have the power to kill it)
* Explain to the Waterdeep Watch, what happen
