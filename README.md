# Night Below

A small repository to store the created resources of my DD5 Night Below campaign on [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

The old AD&D2 Campaign is mandatory, if you want to use this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Below.


After hour of design and test I finally give up on CC3+: to difficult and to long to create something with. 
And I will use only [DungeonDraft](https://dungeondraft.net/) for the dungeon and [WonderDraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net/) for landscape map

For city design, as there are only two towns in the game (Milborne and Thurmaster), I am being lazy and I do not draw anything, just export the old campaign images and for copyright issue I cannot post it here.

~~The old map's remake will be made one day.~~

I use the https://www.forgotten-adventures.net/ Dungeondraft resources bundle.
